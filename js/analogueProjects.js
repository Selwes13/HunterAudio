        text:"Hello, and welcome to the analogue blog. This is where I will discuss ideas that have come out of my ongoing research into analogue character as it relates to audio electronics. This research is based on circuit design: specifically, the sonic differences caused by changing active devices used in circuits (valves vs transistors etc.). It is an interesting area of conversation and the results arenâ€™t always what you think! This blog is a place to share thoughts, upcoming designs, and interesting facts and electronics information. Feel free to get in touch with any thoughts or just for a chat about analogue gear! Jamie",
